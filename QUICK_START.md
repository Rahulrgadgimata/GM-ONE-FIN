## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Header Not Included**: The header component is NOT part of this build. You'll need to integrate it separately.

2. **Backend Integration**: This is frontend-only. You'll need to:
   - Connect to your backend APIs
   - Implement real authentication
   - Add form validation
   - Connect file uploads

3. **Routing**: Uses React Router - all routes are configured in `App.jsx`
